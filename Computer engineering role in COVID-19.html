<blockquote><p style="color:white ;background-color:black">
The use of pattern recognition techniques can be helpful 
for localization the existing of the cells of the virus in
 the body for example Russia uses facial recognition to 
 tackle Covid-19. City officials are using a giant network
 of tens of thousands of cameras - installed with facial 
 recognition software. An interesting New York Times article 
 last week posited that governments’ use of digital surveillance 
 techniques for the COVID-19 response – such as the tracking of 
 geolocation to gauge quarantine restrictions – would lead to more 
 pervasive digital tracking in the future. On a related note, there 
 have been reports of an increased use of facial recognition technologies
 as governments use digital tools to respond to the outbreak.</p>
